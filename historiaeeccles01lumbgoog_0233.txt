cross have been steeped, has restored to health both men an'd cattle
when they have either drunk or been sprinkled with it. The brethren ¹

. of the monastery of Hagustald keep a yearly watch and service omeliis

10 spot for the rest of King Osuald' s soul‚ and a ehurch has since been
built there. As an instance of the miraculous powers of this cross and
all things connected with it, Beda relates the cure of the broken arm of
one of the brethren at Hagustald by means of some moss brought to
him from the cross by one of his fellows.

present deed, he appears to rebel against God who bestowed this power

‚ 35 that Ι (10 not read on the authority of holy fathers, that miracles and

healings were displayed from them, as by the power of the holy cross ;
