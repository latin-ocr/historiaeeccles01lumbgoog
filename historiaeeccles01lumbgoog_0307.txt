N the year 664 AD, distinguished by the eclipse and the pestilence,
archbishop Deusdedit died and on the same month and day died

5 also Erconberct king of Kent. The throne was received by Ecgberct his
son, and he in conjunction with Osuiu‚ king of Northumbria, sent an
Angle named Vighard, a presbyter of great learning, to Rome to be
consecrated archbishop. But Vighard and nearly all his companions
were carried off by a plague before he could be consecrated. The pope

1 0 Vitalian sought carefully for a fit man to send to be archbishop in Eng-
land. His choice first fell on a learned abbat named Hadrian, a native

of Africa, but he excused himself as unworthy of so high a charge, and
suggested that a certain monk named Andrew should be appointed. He
however was too infirm. After some time Hadrian proposed for the pope’s

1 5 acceptance Theodore a monk learned in Greek and Latin, a native of
Tarsus in Cilicia, but then living at Rome. The pope ordained him
first subdeaoen, and then, when his hair was so far grown that he might
receive tlie circular tonsure on the crown of the head, which was the
Roman form, he was consecrated bishop, and started for Britain in
20 company with Hadrian, from whom the pope had required a promise
that he would conduct the new archbishop to his see and take heed that

he introduced there nothing contrary to the true saith. Hadrian had
been into Gaul on two occasions before this. Tbey left Rome May 27
AD 668, and went by sea to Marseilles, then by land to Arles where they

2 5 were detained till Ebrinus the mayor of the palace at this time gave them
leave to travel. Then Theodore visited Agilberct bishop of Paris, and
Hadrian went to the bishops of the Senones and the Meldi, for the
approach of winter forced them to tarry in Gaul. King Ecgberct heard
that they were there and sent an escort for them, but Ebrinus de-
30 tained Hadrian for some time having a suspicion that he was going on
a mission from the emperor into Britain. Eventually finding his fears
groundleSS‚ he let him follow Theodore, and when he arrived in England
