Ξ EBERT'S ACCOUNT OF BEDA.

but withal of rare scientific capacity, so that the middle ages
with one accord named him among the most esteemed teachers

· in the first rank.

Beda, already in the ninth century usually honoured with the
sumame Venerabilis, was born AD 672 in the territory of the 5
abbey of Wearmouth founded two years later ΒΥ Benedict
Biscop. Already in his seventh year he was entrusted by his
relations—being probably an orphan—to the tuition of this
learned abbat, and later to that of Ceolfrid, a friend whom
Benedict had made abbat in a monastery founded by him in the 10
neighbourhood, at Jarrow, which waS, so to speak, a mere off-
shoot of the Wearmouth foundation, so that the two societies
sometimes obeyed the rule of one and the same abbat. In this
community Beda spent his whole life, the genuine retirement of
a scholar, dividing all the time, not engrossed by religious 15
dutieS, between learning and teaching. Other monks als0,
beside the two abbam, gave him lessons, as he himself incident-
ally informs us. No doubt as a consequence of his parts and
energy, he was ordained deacon as early as his nineteenth year,
six years before the canonical age; in his thirtieth year he was 20
admitted to priest's orderS, and now too first began the work of
authorship, for which he found copious materials in the monas—
tic library, collected by the two abbatS, especially in their
journeys to Rome (see further details below pp 7, 8). In order
to study in company with a friend Beda may also now and then 2 5
have left his cloister, as e g he travelled to York for this purpose
to Ecgbert, afterwards archbishop. He died ΑΙ) 735; there is
still extant the report of his last hours by one of his pupils;
even on his death-bed he was busy with literary work, e g with
a translation of St John's gospel into Anglo-Saxon. He was 30
buried in the monastery of Jarrow, to which therefore he must
more specially have belonged.

Beda was a very prolific author, as is sufficiently proved by
that long list of his writingS, which (as if in imitation of Gregory
of Tours) he appended in his 59th year to his church history. 33

⁸⁶ In the same place he gives us.a scanty notice of his own lise.
