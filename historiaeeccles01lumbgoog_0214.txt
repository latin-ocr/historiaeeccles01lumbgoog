THE reputation of Beda survived and grew after his

death. the Saxons were proud that their nation
had produced so eminent a writer 3 the monks of Wear- 10
mouth and Jarrow were harassed with ’ solicitations for
copies of his works3 and, at the distance of a hundred
years, the prelates of the FrankS‚ in the council of Aix-Ia-
Chapelle‚ numbered him among the fathers of the church,
and styled him the venerable and admirable doctor. if the 15
improvements of modern times have diminished the value
of his writingS‚ this circumstance ought no moreto detract
from his merit, than it does from that of the philosophers of
Greece and Rome. Beda was a great man for the age in
which he lived3 he would have been so had he lived in 20
any other age.

' that that 'age possessed more means o'f knowledge, both
in manuscripts and learned ecclesiastiCS‚ than we are wont
