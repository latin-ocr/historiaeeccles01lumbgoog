SUALD reigned nine years, for in his reign was included the on‘e

year of his apostate predecessorS. He was killed by the king of ‘

the Mercians in a battle at Maserfelth. The place where he died has
5 been made illustrious by miracles, The dust of the earth there, when
mixed with water, has healed both men and beasts. The place has
beoome so noted that by taking away the earth there has been made
a hole as deep as a man is high. Beda gives two instances of cures. A
traveller riding near the place found his horse suddenly taken very ill,
I Ο and expected it to die. But in its struggles it happened that the animal
rolled on·to the spot where Osuald had been killed, and it was at once
restored to its wonted strength. The man journeying on, and deeply
impressed with the sanctity of the spot, came to an inn, where the niece
of the master was paralysed. He told of the wondrous eure of his horse,
I 5 and straightway they conveyed the sick girl thither and laid her down.
She fell into a sleep and awoke quite restored, so as to be able to wash
herself, dress her hair, and after that walk home with the friends who
had brought her.

in these accounts of miraculous cures. Thus Adamnan uita St Columbae
11 4 some bread is given by the saint quo in aqua intincto homines ea
conspersi a pecora celerem recuperabant salutem.
