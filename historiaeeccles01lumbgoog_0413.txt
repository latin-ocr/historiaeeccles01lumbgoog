FTER Cudberct’s body had been buried eleven years it was taken

up to be placed in a new coffin. Bishop Eadberct charged that

25 this should be done on the day of the anniversary of his burial. ΤΙιε
body was found all entire, more like one asleep than one dead. The
vestments ton, in which the body was· wrapt‚ were of wonderful
freshness„ News of this was brought to bishopEadberct in a solitude

to which he had retired for devotion. They brought him also some of

30 the vestinents, which he kissed with affection, and commanded them to
put new vestments on the body, saying that the place of Cudberct's
burial would not be long empty. They didas he had bidden‚ and laid
the new coffin on the pavement of the sanctuary. Soon after Eadberct
fell sick, and when he died was laid in the grave of St Cudberct, and
35 over it was placed the new coffin of the saint. At that place many

miracles were wrought.
