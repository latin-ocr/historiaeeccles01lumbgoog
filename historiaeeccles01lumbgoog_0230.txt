FTER the death of Aeduini, his cousin Osric succeeded in the
kingdom of the Deiri‚ and Eanfrid, son of Aedilfrid, to the throne
of Bernicia. Both these monarchs renounced the christian saith, and
fell back into idolatry. Ceadualla king of the Brettones was used
as the instrument of Heaven’s vengeance on them both. He slew
Osric first, in a sally from a town which Osric was besieging, and
before the end of the year Eanfrid was also slain by him when he
had come to sue,for peace. For a year the province of Northumbria
was ravaged by the tyrant Ceadualla. To obliterate the memory ot
these apostate kings‚ and the sufferings of the province during this
unhappy year, the names of Osric and Eanfrid are omitted from
the records of the province, and that year added to the term of the
reign of Oswald, who, succeeding his brother Eansrid, slew Ceadualla
at Denisesburna.

necnon et„ Meuanias Brittonum insulas, quae inter Hiberniam et Brit-

maintained the same boundaries. cf 11 9. Varin 197.
