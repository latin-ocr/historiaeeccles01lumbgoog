Rome but afterwards returned to Britain and preached among
the South Saxons who were ignorant of the divine name and saith.
Their king Aedilualch had already been baptised in Mercia, and
through Wilsrid’s preaching the chiefs and soldiers of the province
20 received baptism. The queen Eabae who was daughter of Eanfrid
had been previously baptised in her own province. A monk from the¹
Scottish nation had a very small monastery in the province os the South
Saxons at a place called Bosanhamm. Not only was spiritual calamity
removed by Wilsrid’s preaching, but also an end was put to a drought
2 5 which had lasted three years. So severe was the famine that the people
threw themselves over precipices or into the sm, but on the very day
when they were baptised‚ rain fell and the land became fruitful. The
bishop also taught the people to get their living by fishing and so turned
their hearts to love him. King Aedilualeh gave the bishop a site for
30 a monastery at selsey, where he lived sor five years baptising many
people among whom were two hundred and fifty men and women slaves,

to whom at baptism he gave their liberty.
