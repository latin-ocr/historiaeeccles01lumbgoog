· 2 5 WHEN Colman left Britain, he first went to the island of Hii with
his Scots and the AngleS, about thirty in number, who were his
companions. After a time they removed to another island on the west
of Ireland named Inis-boufinde. He're he lived with his company os
⁴inonks partly Scots and partly Angles ; but they did not agree together,
30 for the Scots wandered away in the summer time when the crops were
to be gathered, but came and desired to live on the labours of the
Angles in the winter. So Colman found a place in Ireland called
Mageo suitable for a monastery, and buying a piece of land there from
the earl to whom it belonged, he bifilt, with the assistance of the said
35 earl and those who dwelt near, a suitable house and brought thither the
Angles and lest the Scots behind. This monastery is still occupied by
English, and is now called Muigeo and has an excellent company of
monks who live under a rule and canonical abbat.
