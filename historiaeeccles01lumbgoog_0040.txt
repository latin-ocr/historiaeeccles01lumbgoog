of Beda however incorporated in the church history (IV 20) still
remains to us; a hymnus uirginz‘tatzk, as he terms it, in praise
of queen Etheldrida, who became a nun and afterwards abbess 3
it is in distichS‚ where we find the trick of epanalepsiS, already
employed by Sedulius. Beda specially celebrates the miracle, 5
that on the opening of Etheldrida’s coffin after 16 yearS, both
the corpse and the clothing were found intact‚ which passed

. for a special evidence of sanctity. The verses indeed are

without elevation‚ but also without bombast, in a diction neither
mean nor barbarous. of the hymns in Ambrosian metre 10
ascribed to Beda PRIMO DEVS CAELI GLOBVM seems best en-
titled to bear his name. Here we find, as regards the subject-
matter, a parallel drawn (just as in c 10 and the closing chap-
ters of the de temporum ratione) between the six ages of the
world and the days of creation on the one hand, and the passion· 15
week on the other : as regards the form, epanalepsis in the first
main division of the poem, where in each pair of four-line
strophes a day is paralleled with an age of the world ; the first
verse of the first strophe being always made the last os the
second. The same epanalepsis, which here, when confined to 20
strophes on such subjectS, has a certain meaning, is found also
with no such significance in a hymn on the holy innocents’
day, which, probably on this very account, has been attributed
to Beda. The poem on St Cuthbert's miracles we have al-
