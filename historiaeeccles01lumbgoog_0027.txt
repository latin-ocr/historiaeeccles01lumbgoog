ALDHELM has been designated, not unjustly, the father of
Anglo-latin verse: in fact his whole writings have a touch of
poetry, even where their purpose is didactic‚ and however taste·
less his poetic prose-style can become, it at least betrays a lively
5 exercise of fancy. It speaks still more however for Aldhelm’s
poetic nature, that notwithstanding his great interest in, and
comprehension of, the ancient laws of mette, he composed also
in popular rhythmical forms in Latin, as well as in his Anglo-
Saxon mother-tongue. · A very different impression is made by
