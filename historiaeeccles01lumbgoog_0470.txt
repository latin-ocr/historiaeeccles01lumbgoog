Rochester. In the same year he consecrated Laurentius to be his own
successor at Canterbury. The episcopate of Laurentius was termi-
nated by his death in 619 A D. About two years before that date the
district presided over by Mellitus relapsed into heathendom, as also did
that to which Iustus had been appointed. william of Malmesbury only 5
says (de gest pontif 11) a successoribus regulis deturbatus Mellitus Cantu-

’ ariam venit. ibi magno curarum aestu quae sociorum pectora decoquebant

exceptus, coniuncto sibi Iusto, secessit in Galliam. But there was no
bishop appointed to take the place of Mellitus till A D 658 when Cedd
was made bishop among the East SaxonS, and Beda says (111 υ) 10
orientales Saxones fidem, quam olim expulso Mellito antistite abiecerunt,
instantia regis· Osuz‘u receperunt. cf also 11 5.

On the death of Laurentius Mellitus was made archbishop and
dying in 624 was succeeded by Iustus», at whose death in 647 Honorius
came to the archiepiscopal dignity‚ and it is during his episcopate, 15
which continued till 653 A D, that the history contained in these two
books commences.

To the bishopric of Rochester Iustus returned one year aster his de-
parture (he 11 6) and continued to preside over the see till his eleva-
tion to the archiepiscopate, when he consecrated Romanus to be his 20
successor. This prelate was drowned in the Italian sea [h e 11 πο]
when going as a legate from England to pope Honorius 634 A D, and
after him Paulinus at the request of archbishop Honorius took charge
of the see of Rochester, which he held for ten years,

Paulinus had previously been a bishop in the province of North· 2 5
umbria, having converted king Edwin to Christianity 62 5 A D and
having been consecrated bishop by archbishop Iustus [h e 11 91, and
he is accounted the first bishop of York. We also read of the extension
of the missionary labours of Paulinus into Lindsey [h e 11 161, but on
the death of king Edwin 633 A D‘ he was obliged'to leave the northern 30
parts of the land and came along with Edwin’s queen to Kent, when he
was appointed, as has been said, to the bishopric os Rochester, and the
northern provinces were next evangelised by the labours of Aidan who
became the first bishop of Lindisfarne. No other bishop was appointed
as successor of Paulinus at York till the consecration of Ceadda 35
[h e 111 28]-

,. But before 640 A D two missions had been planted in England by
foreigners which may be looked upon as the commencement of two
other sees. In 632 AD, or according to some calculations 636 AD, a
