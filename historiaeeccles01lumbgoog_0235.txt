2] ROMAN WALL. 2 17

was, time out of mind, termed by the Dutch Gots Aere, or Gods ground.
And thus, as Onesimus and Eutychus were so called from their infancy,
but never truely answered their names, till after the conversion of the
one, and reviving of the other: so places (whether casually, or pro·

5 phetically) have names anciently imposed upon them, which are some·
times verified many ages after'.

uallum of Severus, made of earth, is distinguished from a murus of stone.
ibid 11 the Romans dwelt south of this uallum, as is witnessed ‘to this

10 day' by their citieS, lighthouse5‚ bridges and roadS. The passage here
' quoted (supra) is ibid 12 (from Gildas) after the retirement of the
Romans (A D 409) from Britain, the Britons suffered greatly from the
incursions of the Picts and Scots (the barbari here meant). On their
piteous appeal a legion was sent, which drove back the invaders and,
15 on leaving the island, urged the Britons to build a stone wall from sea
to sea. Having no engineer equal to the task, the Britons only raised
a uallum of turf. Again they appealed for help, again a legion is sent,
which built a solid stone wall on the line of the uallum of SeveruS, 8 ft
broad and 12 high, hactenus fizmosum atque conspicuum. See also

Hadriani. - He lays it down as certain that at any rate after Severus no
such fortification was raised in Britain. The wall of Hadrian runs
from Wallsend on the Tyne to BowneSS, almost due E and W, to a
length of 73} miles. It consists of three partsz the uallum (mound of
30 earth and trench)‚ a stone wall with towers at intervals and smaller
sorts of distances of about a mile ; stations or larger forts mostly between
the murus and uallum. Gildas (cf Beda) has wrongly assigned these
three parts to three separate dates. = Beda would have the wall con-
stantly in view, as Jarrow lies at the mouth of the Tyne. Varin <106—
35 120) analyses at great length Gildas and Beda, and gives far too much
weight to their evidence.
