1 5 HEN Wilfrid was driven from his bishopric he first went to
Rome but afterwards returned to Britain and preached among
the South Saxons who were ignorant of the divine name and saith.
Their king Aedilualch had already been baptised in Mercia, and
through Wilfrid's preaching the chiefs and soldiers of the province
20 received baptism. ΤΙιε queen Eabae who was daughter os Eanfrid
had been previously baptised in her own province. A monk from the
Scottish nation had a very small monastery in the province of the South
Saxons at a place called Bosanhamm. Not only was spiritual calamity
removed by Wilfrid's preaching‚ but also an end was put to a drought
2 5 which had lasted three years. So severe was the famine that the people
threw themselves over precipices or into the sea, but on the very day
when they were baptised, rain fell and the land became fruitsul. The
bishop also taught the people to get their living by fishing and so turned
their hearts to love him. King Aedilualch gave the bishop a site sor
30 a monastery at selsey, where he lived for five years baptising many
people among whom were two hundred and fifty men and women slaves,

to whom at baptism he gave their liberty.
