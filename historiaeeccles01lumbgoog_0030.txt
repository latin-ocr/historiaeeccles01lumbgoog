4 EBERT’S ACCOUNT OF BEDA.

Beda himself. The last book (to the year 7 31) concludes with
a survey of the several sees and of the general state of Britain
in that year, when profound peace led many nobles to exchange
arms for cloister life.

We see that the distribution of the subject into books is 5
made with all deliberation‚ being determined by events of the
utmost importance partly in themselve5‚ partly at least for the
author: thus Gregory's death forms indisputably the close of a
period, as a new beginning opens with Theodore’s mission, that
epoch in the Christian civilisation of England. Accordingly the ιο
fourth book, introduced by this nussim, is with the fifth of
greater interest than the rest for the general history of culture
and, at least indirectly, for that of literature also. The earlier
books tell mainly of the propagation and settlement of the
catholic church in the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, its disputes with 15
the church of the Scots and endeavours for reconciliation‚ while
the most important political events, which must affect more or
less the church's position, are considered only in the second
place. In the last two books on the other hand we find here
'and there valuable notices respecting the diffusion of literary 20 .
training by Theodore and Hadrian and their pupiIS‚ the art of
church music introduced from Rome by the pope's arch-chanter
(lv 18, v 20), the studies of the Angles in Rome itself (v 19), the.
circulation and collection of books in England (v 15 and 20),
writers of the rank of Caedmon (lv 24) and Aldhelm (v 18), the 2 5
first missions to Germany undertaken by the Angles (v 9).
Here, it is true, especially in the fourth book, much more room
is engrossed by biographies of saint& bishopS‚ abbats and
abbesseS, which with their miraculous stories for themost part
only prove that England also was possessed by the superstition 30
and ecstasy of the age ς they however not only serve in this
respect to complete the picture of life and manners, but also
throw light on many peculiar features of the education and
character of the Angles, ln particular we may here single out,
as interesting for the national literatures of the middle ageS, two 3 5
visionS, the one (v 12) of a pious Northumbrian, who after death

sees under the guidance of a form of light, evidently an angel,
