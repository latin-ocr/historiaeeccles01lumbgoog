FTER Suidhelm’s death, Sigheri , and Sebbi were kings over the
East Saxons. Sigheri with his people, during the great pesti-
lence, forsook Christianity and set up the idol temples once more
in their province. Sebbi however continued in the true saith. In
consequence of this apostasy king Vulfheri sent bishop Iaruman to

15 recall the people to the saith of Christ, and his preaehing was so suc-
cessful that the heathen temples and altars were all destroyed and the
Christian churehes opened again and the people rejoiced to confess
the name of Christ.
