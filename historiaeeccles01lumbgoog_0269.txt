BOUT this time Sigberct, brother of Earpuald, was king of the

East ‘Angles He had been an exile in Gaul, where he was

baptised‚ and he introduced into his kingdom such schools and teachers

as he had seen in his exile. He was assisted in this by bishop Felix.

20 After a time he resigned his kingdom to a kinsman Ecgric and entered

a monastery of his own building. He was brought from his retirement

to encourage the army when Penda king of Mercia was warring on

East Anglia, but both he and Ecgric were slain in the battle, Sigberct

having carried no weapon with him. After them Anna became king
25 in East Anglia, and was in the end slain by the same Penda.

Ῥ 51 αι EARPVALDVM 11 15 the father Reduald had been baptised in

Kent, but relapsed into heathenism. Earpuald was induced by Edwin

to embrace Christianity with his whole province ς which however, after

the murder of Earpuald by the ⁴pagan Ricberct‚ remained in error for

30 three years, till Sigberct uir per omnia Christianis-simus atque doctissi-

mus (who had lived in Gaul during his brother’s reign) became king,

and by help of Felix, first bp of Dunwich, won back his province to

the saith. Felix was bp 17 years, and was succeeded by Thomas, bp

5 years, and he by Berctgils or Boniface. All three were consecrated

35 by HonoriuS, who died 30 Sept 653 (111 πο). Thus the latest date for

Sigberct's accession is 631. See martyrol Angl 27 Sept. martyrol Gall
