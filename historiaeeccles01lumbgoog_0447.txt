cf p 1851 7. the 9th of May was Ascension day in 720 and again in 799,
but in no intermediate year. In 735, the traditional year of Beda’s death,
- Ascension day fell on the 26th of May, ie vu kal Iun (p 2041 18).
In the calendar Beda’s day is 27 May, which was Ascension day in 751.
20 The date vn id mai is found in no Ms but the St Gallen, and as
the date of that is of the ninth century, it cannot be, as at first sight
suggested itself‚ that the date of the death is confused with that of the
translation. This latter is entered in the calendars (see Nicolas chron
of history) under vl id maii. But this event was long after the date
25 when our ΜΒ was written, having occurred some time between 1021—-
¹04¹ A D. The great difficulty of settling the question of the year of
Beda’s death lies (1) in the uncertainty whether in Cuthbert’s letter the
British or Roman Easter is to be the foundation of our calculations.
Considering however Beda’s own attachment to the orthodox time! of
30 observing that feast, we need not perhaps hesitate to conclude that his
friends would be of the same mind. But (2) we are told that he died
“quarta feria ” (p 178 1 17) ie on Wednesday, Ascension Eve “ad ves-
perum '' (p 179 1 10). Now our Saxon ancestors seem to have reckoned
festivals from the first vcspers (see the authorities cited p 406 n 19).
35 If that be se, they would call the time of his death Ascension day,
though we should call it Ascension·eve. Does then vn id mai or
vn kal iunii (whichever date we take as the correct one) and
which is called diem ascenszbmte dominicae refer to the true Ascension
