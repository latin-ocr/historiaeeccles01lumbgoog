” γιι 2' EBERT'S ACCOUNT off BEDA.

as well as the years of the world, Beda is much more complete
than his predecessor. Britain, as is only fair, is especially
noticed‚ and particularly in the last decads; thus we find here
also mention of Theodore's mission and of the pilgrimages
of the Angles to Rome. Subjoined to this chronicle in the 5
treatise ‘de temporum ⁸ratione' are four more chapters, where
the author briefly‘ discusses the ‘remainder of the sixth age of

’ ¹the world', the times of the Lord's advent and of Antichrist,

the last doomsday, the seventh and eighth ages, In particular
he here (c 67) controverts the opinion, that the various reckon- 10
ings of the years of the world—according to the Hebrew original
or the LXX—could in any way affect the determination of the
last day, which as a divine secret eluded all calculation. The
asserfion, that after the lapse of 6000 years this temporal scene
is at an end, because the millenniums of the world’s duration 15
correspond to the six days of creation, is erroneous3 the days
-of creation refer rather to the ages of the world, which by no
means comprise each 1000 years precisely‚ some being longer,
some shorter. The two surest tokens however of the ap-
proaching judgement are the conversion of the Jews and the 20
reign of Antichrist (c 69). The seventh age of the world is
that of the eterna] sabbath, the eighth that of the blessed resur-
rection. The ages of the world correspond likewise to Christ’s
² passion week, and are mystically signified thereby.

With Beda's chronological studies is connected a tract, 2 5
which also became of importance for the middle ages: his
