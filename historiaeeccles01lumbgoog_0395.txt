singing of creation (Sharon Turner AS 111⁷ 256).

„ 26 NVNC LAVDARE for this Latin 'passage the Saxon version
has the following: Nu we sceolan herigean heofon rices weard. metodes

Drihten aefter teode firum foldan frea aelmihtig.

This goes a little beyond the Latin text of Beda and seems to have

1 5 formed part of some poem in his day known as Caedmon's first song,
but it differs greatly from the introduction of Caedmon’s Genesis which
has come down to uS, though it is like it in subject. In his note to the
Saxon version Smith gives a copy of the above lines from Bp Moore’s
MS with some various readings of interest, the needful word weorc

20 being there given, though not in Alfred's- text as edited by Smith.
Caedmon died about 680 AD.

30 „ 24 CANEBAT the works which have come down to ns under
the name of Caedmon are Genesis, which ,consistS, after the account os
the creation the fall and the flood, mainly of the history of Abraham,
very little being said of the latter part of the book of Genesis; the story
of Exodus‚ which is carried down t‘o the departure from Egypt ς and

3 5 that portion of the book of Daniel which relates the story of the three
Hebrew children and the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream.
Of the other works enumerated in Beda's text we have no trace, nor are
all these which have been preserved to be considered the productions of

the time of Caedmon.
