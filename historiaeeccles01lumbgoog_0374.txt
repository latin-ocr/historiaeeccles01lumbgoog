-5, Maria of Agreda (ἢ- 1658) authoress of the ‘ spiritual city of God ⁹,
famous for her visionS‚ by wearing a cilicium of rough wool covered 5
her body with sores (Zockler Gesch d-Askese Fr a M 1863 p 87, where
is-more on hair shirts, such as Wolsey More lady Margaret wore, and
iron belts, such as we find in Bonis ep p 60 end, Jaffe). So in ‘the life
of St Bridget prefixed to the “Myroure of oure Ladye'' (EETS) p lii', ‘she
never used any lynen eloth, though it were in time of syckneS, but 10
oonly upon hir hed, and next hir skyn she weer ever rough and sharpe
wolen cloth.’ For other examples of the expression to go woolward
the reader may see Christ's own Complaint l 502 (EETS vol 15) ‘to
saste and goo wolle warde ', also the same words are found in Hampole’s
Prick of Conscience l 3514. Palsgrave defines it ‘ Wlwarde without 15
any lynen next one's body. Sans chemyse! The expression is found in
Pierce the Ploughman’s Crede 1 788, ‘ werehen and wolward gon '‚ but
the explanation of the last syllable is, 1 think, to be referred t‘o the

. word wear, and not as Mr Skeat suggests, with the wool towards the

skin‚ an explanation which would only suit with a clothing made of the 20
fleece as it came from the sheep's back. Ward' is wcred the part of
'roerian=to wear, and woolward means “woolclad‚'’ just as in Beowulf
606 sweglwered means “clad in brightne55.” scirwered and ealdawered
may be cited ·as other examples of this participle in composition. It
has sared with woolward‚ when it became a solitary instance os this 2 5
compound, as it did with ngkt‘wz‘se under similar circumstances, The
love for uniform orthography made this latter word into njghteous, and
woolwered into woolward to conform to the shape of fomard and such
like words. The use of go is the same as in the expressions “to go
bare, naked‚ cold &c.'’ We ean find no evidence that sheepskins with 30
wool on were ever worn in England or elsewhere for penance.
