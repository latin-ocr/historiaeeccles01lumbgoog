2 5] SYNOD OF STREANAESHALCH. 269

monastery· rather than change their custom as Alchfrid desired.
Agilberct bishop of the West Saxons and a presbyter named Agatho
were at this time in the Northumbrian province. So a synod was
called at Streanaeshalch for the consideration of this and other questions.
5 Of the one part were king Osuiu, Colman with the Scottish clergy, the
abbess Hild and bishop Cedd, of the other were Alchfrid, Agilberct,
Agatho and Vilfrid.
After much debate‚ the controversy was ended thus. Τὴε Scots had
alleged in defence of their custom, ancient usage and especially the
10 practice of St Columba. In reply Vilfrid urged that the Roman use
was derived from St Peter himself, to whom Christ had given the keys
of the kingdom of heaven and was therefore to be preferred. Osuiu
appealed to Colman, and asked whether St Peter possessed this
authority. When the bishop replied “ It is true, O king‚’' then he
15 enquired: “ Can you shew any such power given to St Columba?''
The bishop said “None.” T hen said the king: “1 dare not longer ,
contradict the decrees of him who keeps the doors of the kingdom of
heaven, lest he should refuse me admission.''
Thereupon the assembly agreed to renounce their use and conform
20 to the Roman observance. ¹

of Greenstead church Essex, as it was till lately. ‘The walls were
30 formed of the trunks of oak trees sawed down the middle. The halves
being cut away at the-bottom into a tenon, were inserted into a groove
cut in a horizontal piece of timber, which served for the base sustaifi·
ment. A second horizonta] piece of timber, grooved like the first,
received by way of entablature the ridges of the trunks, which stood
35 with their sawed faces inwardS, ancl within one inch of each other. At.
the gable ends the trunks rose gradually pedimentwise to the height of
fourteen feet.'
