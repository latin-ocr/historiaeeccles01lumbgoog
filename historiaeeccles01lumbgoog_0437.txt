gospels by the Greek and Syriae. The day before his death he received
the communion. At* the last moment he made the sign of the eross on
his forehead and breast and other parts of the body. nouis-sime autem
colltgtns pedes suos, extendens bracchia et manus super corpus, clam-it

5 oculos suos, psallens hunc uersum leniter: ‘in manus tuas, domine, com·

cf p 18517. the 9th of May was Ascension day in 720 and again in 799,
but in no intermediate year. In 73 5, the traditional year of Beda's death,
· Ascension day fell on the 26th of May, ie vu kal Iun (p 2041 18).
In the calendar Beda’s day is 27 May, which was Ascension day in 751.
20 The date vn id mai is found in no Ms but the St Gallen, and as
the date of that is of the ninth century, it cannot be, as at first sight
suggested itself‚ that the date of the death is confused with that of the
translation. This latter is entered in the calendars (see Nicolas chron
of history) under v1 id maii. But this event was long after the date
25 when our ΜΒ was written, having occurred some time between 1021—-
1041 A D. The great difficulty of settling the question of the year of
Beda’s death lies (1) in the uncertainty whether in Cuthbert’s letter the
British or Roman Easter is to be the foundation of our calculations.
Considering however Beda’s own attachment to the orthodox time! of
30 observing that feast, we need not perhaps hesitate to conclude that his
friends would be of the same mind. But (2) we are told that he died
“quarta feria ’⁹ (p 178 l 17) i e on Wednesday‚ Ascension Eve “ad ves-
perum '' (p 179 l 10). Now our Saxon ancestors seem to have reckoned
,festivals from the first vespers (see the authorities cited p 406 n 19).
35 If that be so, they would call the time of his death Ascension day,
though we should call it Ascension-eve. Does then vu id mai or
vn kal iunii (whichever date we take as the correct 0110) and
which is called dian ascensionis dominicae refer to the true Ascension
