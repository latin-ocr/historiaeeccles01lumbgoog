fasts of Wednesdays and Fddays, or the stationary days of the ancient
church ⁹. Epiphan de fide 22 ‘through the whole year the fast is kept
in the same holy catholic ehurch, I mean on deesday and Friday
(τετράδι καὶ προσαββάτῳ) to the m'nth hour, except only during the whole
pentecost qffifly days, wherein no fast is enjoined '. Tertullian (de ie· 5
iunio 10), when a Montanist, blamed the catholics for teaching non ultra
nonam detinendum. Prud perist VI 54 55 ‘ieiunamus’ ait ‘recuso
potum. Ι nondum nona diem resignat hora’. The nz'nth hour proved.
ultimately too rigorous a limit, and noon was moved backward till it
meant midday. Bonis ep (p 93 end Jaffe) Greg 111 orders that parricides 10

„ 15 QVAM (salutem) PETEBANTVR peto constructed like rogv with
two acc. (a quem· quid verb). Hussey cites 11 12 (p 92 20 S) promisit se 30
quae petebatur esse facturum. But the expression is harsh, forgenti
needs a further definition, whereas saluti is complete in itself. as it
stands», translate:‘ ‘wishing indeed to save the nation‚ as was required
of them, yet”; quae petebat would be more natural.

sermons made no impression on his English auditory. Hard with hard

building went on no better, wherein the austerity and harshnaese of the
pastour met with the ignorance and sturdinesse of the people’. 40
