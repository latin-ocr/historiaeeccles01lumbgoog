N the same monastery dwelt a brother named Badudegn‚ whose
25 duty was to attend on the guestS. One day as he returned from
the sea where he had been washing the robes he kept in the guest-
chamber, he was smitten down with paralysis and with difficulty
reached home. When his disorder increased he went to the tomb
of the most reverend father Cudberct‚ and there praying it seemed as
30 though he had fallen into a sleep, during which he felt a large broad
hand touch his head and the parts of his body affected by disease..
When he awoke he rose up perfectly well and returned with great
joy. The gaz-ments in which Cudberct‘s body had been wrapped
either in life or death were not destitute of healing powers, as may
35 be learnt from the story of his life and virtues-
