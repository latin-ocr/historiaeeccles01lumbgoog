to the royal city of Bebbanburgh‚ which when the king could not
take by siege he ordered to be set on fire. As materials sor his fire he
used the beams and timber work of the villages in the neighbourhood.
When the wind was favorable for his purpose, he set the pile he had
5 made on fire. At this time bishop Aedan was in the island of Farne,
and when he saw the flame he cried unto God, and the wind changing
hurled back the flames on those who had· kindled them. Terrified at
this sign of the protection of heaven the enemy withdrew from the
attack.

not far srom Bebbanburgh. There was a church and a room
2 5 adjoining provided for the bishop who used this and similar lodgings in
his visits through the province. When he died he was leaning against a
wooden prop which adjoined the wall of the church. He was buried in
Lindisfame in the cemetery of the brethren‚ but his remains were after-
wards removed to the right side of the altar of the larger church built
30 there. F inan, also from Hii„ was his successor. When a few years'
after his death the village where he died was burnt down by Penda, the
prop against which the bishop had leaned was not consumed. It was
