of marrying Alchfleda a daughter of king Osuiu, but that monarch
insisted that he and his people should first become Christians. After
hearing the word of truth and professing his faith Peada was baptised 10
by bishop Finan in the town of Ad murum. He took with him into
his kingdom four presbyters to instruct his people and their preaching
was most successful. King Penda himself did not forbid the preaching
of Christianity, but reproached those who did not obey the God in whom
they professed to believe. Penda lived two years after the above named 1 5

Scot, was made bishop of the middle Angles and of the Mercians.
Diuma died shortly after and was suceeeded by Ceollach‚ also a Scot,
