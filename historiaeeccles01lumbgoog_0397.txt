[XXV]

T this time the monastery called Coludi Urbs was consumed by fite

for the wickedness of those who dwelt in it. These like the Nine-

vites had been previously warned. For Adamnan, a Scottish monk —of

5 great strictness of life, foretold the coming fire. This manin his youth
had committed some great wickedness. He went to a priest ‘and
confessed‚ and by the direction of the confessor he was ordered to· be
instant in fasting and psalms and prayers. His great grief made him
anxious to submit to more penance and he proposed to his confessor to
10 spend the whole night in prayer, standing, or to pass the whole week
in abstinence. The priest imposed a somewhat lighter penance and
departing to Ireland there died. Adamnan continued regularly the
penance which had been imposed, so that he took food only on the fifth
day of the week and on the Lord's day. When he had diligently pur·

1 5 sued this course of life for a long time, he went for some distance from
the monastery, accompanied by one of the brethren. As they were
returning, Adamnan soretold to his companion that the whole building
would soon be reduced to ashes. For, said he, 1 lately saw while occu-
pied in my vigils a vision of one who told me that 1 did well, but that
20 none of the ,other members of the monastery were occupied with care
sor their souls. The ce115‚ said he, are made into places for revelling
and drinking and other allurements, and the nuns whenever they have
leisure spend their time in weaving fine garments for their adornment‘.
Wherefore this place shall be burnt with raging flames. When asked

25 by the abbess why he had so long kept silence, he said, I feared to
speak lest you should be too much troubled, but the stroke shall not
fall in your days. Some little reform followed the publication of this
vision, but when the abbess died they again returned to their old way

of life. Tberesore while they spake of peace, sudden destruction came
30 upon them. Beda relates this on the authority of Aedgils, a fellow

presbyter, to admonish people how terrible the Lord is in his counsels ·

concerning the sons of men.
