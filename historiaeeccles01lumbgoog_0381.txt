IN· the ninth year of king Ecgfrid a battle was fought near the
river Trent between him and Aedilred king of Mercia. Tbere a
brother of king Eegfrid was slain‚ named Aelsuin. The war seemed
likely to grow fremet, but through the exhortations of archbishop
20 Theodore the two kiugs and people were appeased and no man 's
life taken for the king's brother who had been slain, only his wergyld
paid to king Ecgfrid.

wilfrid (v 19 p 206 30. Eddius 24) eo die anniuersario Elswin
regis occisi cadauer in Eboricam delatum est, omnes populi

30 ‚, 30 TREANTA because in will Malmsb the name of the
‘prince kined in this batt1e is given as Aeduinus, smith inclines ιο
place the battle-field in Yorkshire near Hatfield, but there seems to
be greater probability in the suggestion of Elsord (i e Aelfwin’s ford)
on Trent as the scene of the battle, and Gibson in his additions to
35 Camden col 5 37 describes a tumulus which may perhaps have been
erected to commemorate this event.
