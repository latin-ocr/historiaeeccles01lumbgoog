HE monastery of Bai-king was made famous by many heavenly
signs. One of these Beda relates. At the time of the mortality
which has been so often mentioned, the disease first attacked the monks
and many of the brethren died. It then spread to the sisters and the 15
mother of the congregation asked anxiously of those who were sick in
what place they would desire to be buried if they should be taken
from the world. From them she had no answer, but one night after
matins were ended and these handmaids of Christ had gone out of the
oratory, a bright light came down from heaven and resting on a spot to 20
the south of the monastery marked that place out as divinely appointed
for the burial-place. This radiance was greater than the light of day,
and was noticed by one of the brethren as making its way through the
chinks of the doors and windows‚ and he spake of it on the following
morning. 2 5
