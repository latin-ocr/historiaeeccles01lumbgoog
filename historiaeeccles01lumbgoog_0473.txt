mode of reckoning the time os the Easter festival came to be regarded
as heretics. ’

But the Easter question of which so much is said in Beda's history
was not a dispute between Eastern and Western churchea but between
5 two branches of the Western church which had been in earlier times at
one. In the letter of the emperor Constantine sent forth to the churches
after the council of N ieaea it is stated (Socr h e 1 9)» that in Britain there
was the same unanimity of sentiment at that time concerning the ob-
servance of Easterlaevhich prevailed in the rest of the Western church.
10 But the history of Beda shews that there had arisen before his day a
serious diversity between the British use and that of the¹ church of
Rome, and we are told by him of an occasion on which king Oswy who
followed the British calculation was keeping his Easter and had con·
cluded the Lenten fast, while his queen who had been trained in the
1 5 Roman use was still fasting and keeping Palm Sunday. 'sbis difference
is of quite another character from that which disturbed the harmony of
the Eastern and Western churcheS, and as Beda observes (h e 111 4)
had arisen because Britain lay too far away to be made aware of the
synodic decrees issued from time to time by the Roman church for the
20 proper fixing of Easter. Both the British and Romish Christians kept
the festival on the first day of the week. At the time of the N icene
council the festival was calculated according to the 84 years cycle, called
after Sulpicius Severus but in use a long time before his date, and this
made Easter-day to be the Sunday which fell next after the equinox be-
25 tween the 14th and aoth days of the moon inclusive. To this cycle the
British church still adhered (see p 275). · But the cycle of 84 years had
been supplanted at Rome first by the cycle of 5 32 years of Victor of
Aquitaine and then by that of ¹9 years of Dionysius Exiguus, Ac-
cording to this latter method of reckoning, Easter day was to be the Α
30 Sunday next after the equinox between the 15th and arst days of the
moon. From this variation adopted in the mode of calculating Easter
by the Roman church and from her by nearly all the West we can see at
once hoW, if the 14th day of the moon fell on Sunday, that would be
Easter day to Oswy and the Britons, while to those who followed the

35 Roman use the 21st day of the moon would be Easter day.
But we learn from this that the controversy of which Beda says so
much was a very different matter from the Quartadeciman dispute be·
tween the Eastern and Western churches of old. 'rhe British church
