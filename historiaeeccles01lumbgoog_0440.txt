P 177 20 ο REX GLORIAE the antiphon for the magnificat on the
feast of the Ascensiou (breuiarium Rom in ascensione domini ‘ in 11 ·
uesperis '); the only words omitted are sed mitte promtu-um patris in nos
spiritum um'tatzlr. Beda has a homily (11 9 in Migne xcw 174—181) 10
on the Ascension‚ which concludes thus: ‘ Behold in our Redeemer’s
ascension we have learnt to what end all our endeavours must be bent:
behold, as the Mediator of God and men ascends into the heavens, we
have learnt that the gate os the heavenly fatherland is thrown open to men.
Let u's therefore hasten with all zeal to the everlasting happiness of this 1 5
fatherland. In this, as in body we cannot yet dwell, let us ever dwellin
desire and mind. According to the saying of the noble preacher, let ns seek
things above, where Christ is seated at God’s right hand, let us mind
the things above, not the things which are on earth. Let us seek Him
and be established by the hope of findingz let us seek His sace ever· 20
more, and when He who was meek in His ascent, shall be terrible in
His return, may He find us ready to be introduced with Him to² the
festivals of the heavenly city.’ .
