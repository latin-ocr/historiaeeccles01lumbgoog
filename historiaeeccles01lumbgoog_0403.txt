N the year in which king Ecgfrid died Cudberct was ordained bishop
of Lindisfarne. For several years he had lived a monastic lite in the
little island of Farne. This man from his earliest youth had a desire for
the religious life and first entered the monastery of Mailros, over which
10 a priest of great virtue and prophetie powers named Boisil was then
provost under abbat Eata„ At Boisil’s death Cudberct succeeded him
as provost and laboured much to convert the common people from their
evil works, For many of them led foolish lives and in a time of plague
had recourse to idolatrous remedies as though they could obtain health
1 5 through incantations or spells. Cudberct laboured hard against this error
and had great influence both through his skill in speaking and because of
the grace of his countenance. He feared not to travel in the most inac-
cessible districts and frequently tarried away from the monastery two or
three weekS‚ dwelling among the mountaineers and teaching them both
20 by word and work} After many years Cudberct was removed to
Lindisfarne where from old times had resided a bishop with his clergy
and an abbat with his monks. This institution had existed since the
time of bishop Aidan who in the beginning thereos had followed the
instructions received from pope Gregoryby Augustine.
