sought the society of Peter, why he imitated the tonsure of him whom 5
Peter anathematised?' He repliedt ‘Though, brother beloved, Ι have

‘Simon’s tonsure after the fashion os my country, yet Ι detest with all my
mind Simoniac perfidy.' 1 rejoined: ‘What you embrace in the heart,
you should display openly.' N aiton decreed that all the clerks of his
r'ealm should accept the tonsure ‘so full of reason.' adtondebantur 10

the obstinacy of the Britons in defending their national tonsure, that of
Simon Magus, and rejecting that of St Peter. capitula sel can Hibern ·2 5
