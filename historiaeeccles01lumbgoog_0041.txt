afford a fresh proof of Beda's rare accomplishmentS, however
little they may betray of poetic genius· ’
The theory also both of poetry and of prose gave occu-

pation to Beda's pen: ‘thus he composed a tract on orthography5

5 a book DE SCHEMATIS ET 'mons SACRAE scmPTVRAE, in
which he defines these rhetorical figures one by one and illus-
trates them by examples from the bible, which even in respect
of such modes of expression surpasses all other books: a tract
DE ARTE METRJCA (to which the last named is appended). This
10 is far more interesting than the other two; for though in great
part a mere extract from earlier metricistS, especially VictorinuS,

it yet furnishes many details important for literary history,
partly by the citations from christian writers of latin verse,
partly by the conception (which became in some ‘cases authori-

15 tative for after times) os individual pointS, though indeed this
was by no means peculiar to Beda personally. In regard to
the conception it is⁸ specially to be remarked, that Beda, as
already hinted‚ considers the iambic dimeter of the Ambrosian
hymns as a tetrameter and so calls it (c 21), so that he regards
20 the verses of the iambic four-line strophe merely as uersiculi
(in him=hemistichs)‚ of which two go to make a uersus. The
four-line strophe of the trochaic hymns (derived from the distich

of the tetrameter trochaicus) has evidently misled him to this

conception.

25 ⁸ In this view Beda follows

Cassiodorus cited above 482 [in his ’

commentat-y on the psalms, e g

3, 23} It is remarkable that he

so entirely identifies the vulgate

30 with the original, as to borrow

from it examples even of homoeo-
teleuton.

¹³ See above 116 n. [Beda de

arte metrica c 17 cites as example

35 os phalaecian metre the first 15

verses from the canticum of the

‘ exodus’ ascribed to Iuvencus (spi-

cileg solesm 1 187) without naming

him as author, though elsewhere

40 in his citations he does name his '-

authoritie3‚ eg Iuvencus himself
c 3 in a citation from the ‘hist
euangelica’. The verses of the
canticum however are simply in,-
troduced by the words ‘huius
(metri) exemplum', which may
warrant the inference‚ that even
Beda in his day did not know the
author. For the rest thequotation
offers some noticeable readings]
⁹⁴ So only can we explain the
remarkable passage also which is
cited above 171 n 2 [de arte metr
c 11 hymnos uero quos choris
alternantibus canere oportet, necesse
est singultis· uersibus ad burum esse
