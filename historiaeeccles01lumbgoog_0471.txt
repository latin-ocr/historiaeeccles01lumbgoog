1v] BISHOPRlcs. 42 5

Burgundian bishop named Felix came to Honorius the archbishop and

was by him sent to preach among the East Angles, whose first bishop
he was made and had his episcopal seat at Dunwich [h e 11 15]-

In like manner Birinus sent from Italy by pope HonoriuS, was made

5 a bishop among the West Saxons about 634 AD, and his seat was at

Dorchester in Oxfordshire.

Thus, beside the archiepiscopal see, there had been founded though
not in a very permanent manner two sees in the province of North-
umbria, and four in the southern and eastern parts of the kingdom

10 before 640 AD.
