HE episcopate of archbishop Theodore continued for more than
twenty-one years· He travelled throughout England‚ teaching the

10 right rule of life and the canonica] observance of Easter. He united
under himself the whole church of the Angles‚ and caused instruction to be
given in both sacred and secular learning. Ecclesiastical arithmetic,
astronomy and metrical rules were taught, and Latin and Greek so that
in Beda’s days some of the scholars were living who could speak both

1 5 these languages as well as their own. This was a happy period for Britain.
All the churches began to learn singing, which hitherto had only been
used in the churches of Kent. Aeddi, invited by Wilfrid from Kent, was
a great teacher of church music. Theodore objected to the consecration
of bishop Ceadda, whereupon that prelate expressed his willingness to

20 resign his episcopate. But the archbishop completed his ordination
according to catholic custom and he continued in his office. Wilfrid,
who had been sent into Gaul for consecration‚ returned before the
arrival of Theodore and ordained priests and deacons in Kent. When
Theodore came he ordained Putta to be bishop of Rochester which see

2 5 had been a long time vacant. Putta was especially skilled in Gregorian
chanting.
