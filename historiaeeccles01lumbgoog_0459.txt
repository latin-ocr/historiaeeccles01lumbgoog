ACCOUNT OF THE MSS USED FOR THIS
VOLUME.

HE Ms from which the text is printed is in the Cambridge univer·

5 sity library (Kk 5 16). It is a large quarto MS on vellum, written ,
in the 8th century. It is known as bishop Moore’s MS, for that prelate
(formerly bp of Ely) bequeathed it to the university. It was probably ,
written during Beda's life. There are two hands to be traced in the
MS, which is written very carefully. It appears to have been carried -

10 into France soon after it was finished, and to have belonged to a monas- θ
tery dedicated to St Julian. It was sold by auction in the reign of
William 111 and passed into the hands of Dr Moore and so to its pre-
sent guardians. *See Hardy‚ catalogue os MSS relatz'ng to the early ,
