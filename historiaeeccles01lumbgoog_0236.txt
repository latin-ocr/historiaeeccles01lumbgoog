HEN Oswald was settled in his kingdom he sent to the ScotS,

among whom he had so long lived, and begged them to send him
a bishop who might instruct his people in the Christian saith. Tbey 20
sent him bishop Aedan, a man of exemplary piety, though he still
kept Easter after the custom of the northern peoples and not according
to Roman use. His see was established in the island of Lindisfarne,
and he laboured earnestly for the spreading of the saith. The king
often acted as interpreter when Aedan was preaching, for the bishop 2 5
had not mastered the English language. Many clergy came afterwards
from the country of the Scots into England, and churches and monas-
teries were built in good number. Aedan was a monk of the famous
monastery os Hii, which island had been given by the Picts to the
Scottish monks a long while before. 30
