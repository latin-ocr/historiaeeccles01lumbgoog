next spring Daegberth‚ king of the Franks, who had been an exile in
1reland, and had received supplies srom wilfrid on his return, enter·

him on his way loaded with presentS. He next came to king Berchter
of Campania, who also refused the price set on his head, and sent him 5

„ 18 DIVERTENS F uller ἕ 97 ‘ Theodorus, archbishop of Canter- 15
bury, beheld Wffride bishop of York (one of great parts and greater
passions) with envious eyes3 and therefore, to abate his power, he
endeavoured that the diocese of . York might be divided. Wilfn'de
offended hereat goes over to Rome to impede the project, and by the
way is tossed with a grievous tempest. It is an ill wind which bloweclt 20
no man profit. He is cast on the shoar of Freezland in Bag-ia, where
the inhabitants as yet pagans, were by his preaching eonverted to Chris-
tianity. This may be observed in this Wffride, his πάρεργα. were better
than his ἔργα, his casuall and occasionall were better then his inten-
tionall performancar, (which shews plainly, that providenee acted more 2 5
vigourously in him, then his own prudence z) 1 mean, when at ease in
wealth, at home, he busied himself in toyes and trifles of ceremonious
controversies ς but when (as now, and afterwards). a stranger and little
better than an exile, he effectually promoted the honour and glory ot'
God. §98- And as it is observed of nightingales, that they sing the 30
sweetoet‚ when farthest from their nestsz so this Wilfride was most
diligent in God’s service, when at the greatest distance from his own
home. For though returning into England, he returned not into York,
but stayed in the pagan kingdom of the Soutk Saxam, who also, by
God's blessing on his endeavourS, were persuaded to embrace the 3 5
