’ St Osuald's bones, His niece Osthryda queen of the Mercians
caused this to be done, and the remains were conveyed to the monastery
of Beardaneu. But the midland monks did not like the northern saint,

However a column of light shone all night through from heaven upon
the place where the body lay, and won by this manifestation the monks
afterwards paid due reverence to the saint. The water in which the
relies were washed was poured down in a corner of the sacristy and the

2 5 earth in that spot became endued with miraculous virtue. Abbess
Aedilhild begged some of this earth and carried it with her in a casket,
and it proved effectual to cure one who was possessed with an evil spirit.
The restored demoniac testified that the spirits which tormented him ssed
as soon as the maid bearing the casket came into the hall.
