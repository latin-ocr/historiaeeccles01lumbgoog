* 6 EBERTS Acco UNT OF BEDA.

Northumberland‚ in order, as he sayS, to leave theu reader no
ground for doubt. The most eminent clergy of the several
provinces aided his undertaking 3 one brought him also from

, ψ Rome transcripts of bulls from the papal archiveS. Everywhere

we discern the pursuit of truth and that faithful reproduction 5
of tradition, which, as he himself says in his preface, is· ‘the
true‘law of history’. Moreover Beda appears throughout this L.
work as a master of the learning of his times, with whose com-
prehensive knowledge probably no man then living could vie3
he can discover and appreciate what is really important, though 10
no less a dupe to the current saith in miracles than the far more
ignorant and unenlightened historian of the Franks, If in his ,
opinion also (as the preface tells us) the worth of history is prin· -
cipally moral, as it incites us to imitate good and avoid evil, yet
in the narrative itself the moral tendency is less obtrusive than 15
in Gregory of Tours. It bears throughout the stamp of a rare
fairness and objectivity, which is maintained even in ecclesiasti·
cal matters, as in relation to the ScotS. Herewith accords the
calm, even tone of the relation, which in its diction, clear,
natural and yet for the age so pure, affords the surest evidence 20
of mental discipline won by the study of the ancients and of the
chief fathers of the church.

A supplement to the great historical work—important
especially for the history of civilisation and often exceedingly
attractive——is Beda's little book, founded partly on a sermon 2 5
