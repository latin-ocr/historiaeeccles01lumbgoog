360 . THE ABBESS HJLD. ⁸ [IV

and wnfrid 0f' the ehureh of York, ortfor went into Kent to archbishop
Theodore‚ and afterwards to Rome. On his return to Britain he was

elected bishop of the Huiccii and ordained by bishop wilfrid. For ’

Bosel the prelate of the Huiccii was too infirm to discharge his
episcopal dutieS. Tatfrid, also from Hild’s monastery, had been elected

= bishop in that province before Bosel, but died before consecration.

The fame of Hild's piety extended to a distance, for her mother
Bregusuid had dreamed while Hild was young and her husband
Hereric in exile that he was suddenly taken from her and while
seeking for him she discovered under her robe a most precious neck·
lace which appeared to shine with a light that filled all the limits
of Britain. This dream was fulfilled in her daughter. This abbess
Hild was sick with violent sever for six years, yet she never omitted
her thanks to her Maker or the public and private teaching of her
flock. In the seventh year of her sickness she carne to her end, and
before her death exhorted tbe handmaids of Christ to keep >peace
with one another. On the night. of her death God sent a vision
indicative thereos to a holy woman named Begu, who lived in another
monastery at Hacanos (Hackness), for Begu when resting in the dor-
mitory heard suddenly the sound of the bell which was wont to be
rung when one of them died. The roof of the house appeared also
to be uncovered and a great light to shine from above. She saw also
the soul of Hild borne to heaven by angels. She told her vision
at once and said that Hild the mother of them all had just departed
from the world. The deputy-abbess who heard this roused all the
sisters to prayer and at dawn there came messengers announcing Hild’s
death. To them they related the account of this vision. Hacanos is
thIrteen miles distant stom strenaeshalch. It is also said that Hild
appeared in a vision on the same night to one of the women of her
own monastery, who, judging that the abbess was dead, called on
those who were with her to pray for her soul.
