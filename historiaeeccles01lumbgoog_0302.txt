XXIX

N archbishop Deusdedit was dead, the kings Osuiu and Ecgberct
chose the presbyter Vighard as fit to be archbishop and sent him

to Rome to be ordained, and that he afterwards might ordain other
bishops for the churches in Britain. But Vighard died at Rome before 5
he could be consecrated, and the pope Vitalian wrote to 'king osuiu,
exhorting him to follow the rule of St Peter in the keeping of Easter,
and promising, as soon as he should be able to find a fit man, to send a
bishop to preside over the British church and to instruct the people. Hc
deplores the death of Vighard and sends by the bearers of his letter some 10
relies as presents to the king and his queen. Lastly he exhorts him to
labour for the spread of Christianity through the whole island of Britain.
The account of him who was sent in Vighard‘s stead is reserved sor the
next book.
