EDA will not omit another miracle wrought by the relies of
St Cudberct, for he learnt it from the very> brother on whom
it was wrought. When Suidberct was abbat of the monastery of Dacore‚ 25
a youth there had an unsightly tumour ou one eyelid. Many remedies
were tried, bnt to no purpose, until one of the presbyters named Thruidred,
who is now abbat of the monastery, gave to the young man a part of
St Cudberct’s hair that he might place it in the repository of relies out
of which it had been taken that a part might be sent elsewhere. By a 30
salutary impulse the youth applied the relic to his diseased eyelid before
he restored it to its place. This was at the second hour of the day and
at the approach of the sixth hour in accordance with his saith he found
on touching his eye that the eyelid was as sound as though there had
never been a tumour upon it. 35
