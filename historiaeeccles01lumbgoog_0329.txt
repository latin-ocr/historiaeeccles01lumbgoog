,, 12 eLomzsnocn Haddan-Stubbs 111 122 ‘that clovesho was
either in Mercia or in some kingdom subordinate to Mercia, 1105 been
rightly inferred by Smith and others from the fact that all the recorded
councils of Clovesho date within 0 period coincident with the pre·

20, dominance of Mercia, and that the Mercian kings take the lead in them,
often without the presence of any other king at all. It is singular that
no recorded council of Clovesho occurs until the celebrated one under
abp Cuthbert [yet in Haddan-Stubbs 111.3oo we find 0 0000011 of
Clovesho Α 1) 716, 43 years after the council of Hertford] seventy years

25 [AD 74² Haddan-Stubbs 111 340—342] subsequent to the appointment
of the place for 0 yearly synod. There is indeed in the interval only
one genuine council of the entire Anglo·Saxon church of which the
place is recorded, except those of Twiford and Onestresfeld, the circum·
stances of which account for their locality. That one is Theodore's

30 own council of Hatfield in Α 1) 680; and it is curious that he should
himself desert the place which he had fixed on only seven years before.
Boniface's expression in AD 742 ‘⁶ Synodus Londinensisst and all
the probabilities of the case, indicate London or its immediate neigh-
bourhood!

35* It 1105 been conjectured that clofeshoch is Cliff or Cliffe·at·Hoo
five miles from Rochester. ' .
