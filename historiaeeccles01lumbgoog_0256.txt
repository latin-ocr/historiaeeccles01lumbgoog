Osuald had been killed and saw the grass was greener than in
other placeS, and concluded that some holy man had been slain there. 2 5
He gathered some of the dust and carried it with him in a eloth. On
his way he came to a village where while he was entertained, he tied the
eloth containing the dust to a post in the wall. The house of his enter-
tainers happened to catch‘fire, yet though all else was consumed the post
to which the eloth was hung was found untouched by the flames. Such 30
miracles made the place of Osuald’s death famouS, and many came
thither and were healed. .
