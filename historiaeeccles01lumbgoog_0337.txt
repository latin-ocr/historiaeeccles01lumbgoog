, EDILBURGA was succeeded in her office of abbess by a haudmaid
of God named Hildilid‚ and great care was exercised by her for

, many years in the discharge of all her duties. She determined on

5 account of the want of space near the monastery that the bones of
those holy ones who had been buried there should be removed into the
church of the blessed Mother of God, and when this was done bright
lights appeared from heaven, and a marvellous fragrance was felt, as is
told in the work from which Beda makes his extracts. He relates one

10 miracle which took place at that cemetery, The wife of a certain carl
who lived near wasvafflicted with a disease of the eyes and at last became
quite blind.. Thinking that if she were brought to the monastery of these
holy virgins and prayed near the relies of the saint she should recover,
she caused her maidens to bring her thither. She was perfeetly restored,

’ 15 and walked home by herself as though she had been deprived of tem-
poral light only that her cure might shew what virtue and light belongs
to the saints in heaven.

P 110 8 fflLleD to her Aldhelm dedicates the prose edition of
his de laudibus uirginitatis. cf Alford 705. A vision related by her to

20 Boniface is repeated by him ep 10 Jaffe. Cuthburga (sister of Ina king
of Wessex) was first a nun at Barking under her, and then foundress
and first abbess of Wimbourne (Wm Malmesb reg Angl1 α). cf AA
