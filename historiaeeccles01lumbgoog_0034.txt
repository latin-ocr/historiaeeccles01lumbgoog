8 EBERPS ACCOUNT OF BEDA.

to England the papal arch-chanter, who became in the ‘first
-instance the teacher of his monastery, in particular of our Beda;
but from all English convents monks resorted to him to leam
singing. Thus Benedict promoted England’s civilisation in the
most various direction3‚ and Ceolfrid emulated his example. The 5
picture of these admirable men appears in their scholar’s beauti-
ful tract the more serene, as no sort of miracle is recorded of them.

Another¹ supplement to Beda's church history, to which, as
of much earlier date, he also alludes in the course of it, is the
book DE VITA ET MIRACVLIS S CVTHBERTI EPISCOPI LINDIS- 10
FARNENSIS. This prose work, undertaken at the request of a
successor of Cuthbert'S, Eadfrid, and of the monks of Lindis-
farne, adopts here and there the language of an earlier work
of Beda's, a poem DE MmAcvms s CVTHBERTI. It is not
however a mere version of this latter, but an independent work, 1 5
as appears even from the presace. Beda, as he there assures
us, had taken all pains to report the truth, having first com-
municated his manuscript to some monks long intimate with
Cuthbert, and then submitted a copy revised in accordance
with their judgement to the criticism of a meeting of elders and 20
teachers of Lindisfarne monastery, who however found nothing
further to alter. The difference between the subject-matter of
the prose life and the poem is correctly indicated by their titles ε
in the latter only the miracles are recorded, while the former
embraces in additionthe remainder of the saint’s life. Beda 25
had indeed promised such a supplement in the preface to his
poem. As regards the subject-matter therefore, it will suffice
here to notice the prose work, the poem, as regards its form,
being reserved for later consideration. ‘The main source bow-
ever, from which Beda drew his materiaIS, is still extant, a life 30
of the saint by a monk of Lindisfarne.

Still Beda's vrrA CVTHBERTI, in spite of all well-meant
precautions in the interest of historic truth and in spite of the
citation of eyewitnesseS, is distinguished from his VITA ‚AB-
BATVM, as a historical romance from history. The romantic 35
