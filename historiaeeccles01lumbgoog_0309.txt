pass unadulterated to Beda) was induced to return home with Theodore‚

Hadrian with more suspicion than he did upon Theodore.

„ 27 TONSVRAM p 7ο l 2o n. p 76 l 24 n. Ceolfrid in his letter
to Naiton king of the Picts (v 21) treats at large of the tonsure (p 214
l 34 seq S) hortor ut ecclarae'asticam et Christianae fidei congruam habere

church one only form of tonsure. Job let his hair grow in prosperity,
shaved it off in his troubles. Joseph wore his hair long in prison, shaved
it offon his discharge. The difference of tonsure does not hurt those who
have a pure faith in God and love to their neighbour; esp as the catholic
2 5 fathers had no controversy about it, as about Easter or the faith; still of
all tonsures found in the ehurch or in mankind, 1 may justly say that we
should embrace none more than that worn on his head, to whom the
Lord said Tues Petrus ,· should detest none more than his to whom Peter
said ‘Thy money perish with thee.' Nor are we shorn in coronam only

this tonsure we declare {pso ettam frontispiczb our readiness to bear
mockeries for our Lord’s sake, and our hope of the crown which he has
promised to them that love him. cetemm tonsuram eam quam magum

primo detestetur et merito exsufflet adspectu ? At first sight it looks like a
crown, but as you follow it to the neck, decurtatam eam quam te uidere
putabas inuenies coronam. Such a habit befits Simoniaczlr et non Chris-
almis, who will miss the crown everlasting. Not that all will be rejected
