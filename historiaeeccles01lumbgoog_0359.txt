to a little boy who was lying sick and told him that they were about to
conduct him to the celestial kingdom. They bade him call Eappa the
presbyter and say that the Lord had heard their prayers and accepted
their fasting and no more of them should die. The messengers also said
ss 5 that the divine pity was shewn to them through the intercession of
Oswald, formerly king of Northumbria, who as on that day had been
slain and received into heaven: They also bade that masses should be
celebrated in all the oratories of the monastery. The boy described the
heavenly visitors as bright and shining and more beautiful than he had
10 ever seen. One was shorn like a cleric, the other had a long beard, and
they told him that they were Peter and Paul. After search it was found
that king Oswald was slain on this day, therefore the boy’s story was
believed, and on that very day he died, but all the rest recovered. This
vision increased the reverence for‘fasts and in many places king Oswald’s
15 day was observed with yearly masses.

the presbyter when at the point of death (Greg dial Ν 11) ‘ bene ueniant

uestrum estis dzgmati conuenire ? uenio, uenia. gratias ago '. when this
