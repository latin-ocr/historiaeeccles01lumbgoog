5 ‚, 31 ANAcnoRETmA v 12 (p 197 20 S) Haemgils a solitary
in Ireland, living on bread and water. It was a British anchorite
who tried Augustine by the test of humility and found him wanting
11 α (p 80 1 4 S). Victberct went as a missionary to the Frisians (V 9
p 191 l 37), cum esset et ipse contemptu mundi ac doctn‘nae scz’entia

4Ῑο insignis, nam multos annos in Hibernia peregrinus anachoreticam in
magna perfectione uitam egerat. St Guthlac's lise in his ‘ancer-setle' at
Crowland is thus described (c 4) ‘ He resolved that he would use
neither woollen nor linen garment‚ but that he would live all the
days of his life in clothing of skins. Each day from the time that

15 he began to live in the wilderness the abstemiousness of his diet was
such 'that he never tasted aught but barley bread and water; and when
the sun was set then he took his food on which he lived?

P 57 1 VLTANVM he was abbat of the monastery of Peronne
and died 1 May 686 A D Gall Christ 111 933. 1x 1036. ’

dicere possem, tolerated by his brethren ,and superiors for his skill
as a carpenter, spending night and day in his workshop, rather than

side of Caiaphas. h a 7 the abbat Easteruini after forsaking the
career of arms assumpta militia spirituali tantum mansit humilis
fratrumque simillimus aliorum, ut uentilare cum eis et triturare oues
uitulasque mulgere, in pistrino in horto in coquina in cunctis monasterii

30 operibus iucundus et obediens gauderet exerceri .. . . saepe pro curandis =

monasterii negotiis alicubi digrediens, ubi operantes inuenit fratres,
solebat eis confestim in opere coniungi uel aratri gressum stiua regendo
uel serrum malleo domando uel uentilabrum manu concutiendo uel
aliud quid tale gerendo. mirac Cuthb 20 (11 23 9 St) sums up the
35 monk's life as excubiasque flentemque preces manuumque laborem.
uita Cuthb 19 pr at first Cuthbert received from the brethren (in his
solitary life c 18) a very little bread through a window and drank
from his own well: after a while he resolved‚ according to the example
of the fathers, to live by his own hand-labour. Seed-wheat and tools
