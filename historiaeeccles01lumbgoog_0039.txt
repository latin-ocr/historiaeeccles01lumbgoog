CHRONOLOGY, MARTYROLOG Y, POEMS. 13

MARTYROLOGIVM, DE NATALICIIS SANCTORVM DIEBVS, as
Wattenbach sayS, ‘the ground work of all later revisions '
itself however naturally founded on earlier, especially Roman,

martyrologieS. In this calendar of martyrS, in which however

5 even Beda could not yet fill every day, the toi-tures are related
at great length for a calendar, and we have often real cause,
for amazement, how so learned, and indeed enlightened, a man

as Beda, not merely credulously accepted the most absurd and
loathsome exaggeration5‚ but has also repeated them with a
10 certain relish3 read eg the sufferings'of St Pachomius (14

May).

This seems to me noticeable with reference to the

arts of design and the later drama of the middle ageS.
On these writings‚ relating to history and historical science‚
rests Beda's great influence on the literature and culture of the
15 middle ages; these also display in the ‚most brilliant light his
genius and learning. These 'prose writings throw his poems
entirely into the background. Trne, he wrote much in verse;
he cites himself, in the catalogue of his works, beside the poem
DE M1RAcvms s cv‘fflBERTI, also an entire LIBER HYMNORVM
20 DIVERSO METRO SIVE RHYTHMO and a LIBER EPIGRAMMATVM
HER01co METRo SIVE ELEG1Aco, but both are lost, and of
the few separate hymns and epigrams ascribed to him, scarcely
one or two can claim a slight likelihood of authenticity. We
may reasonably infer that the two collections deserved the doom
25 of oblivion, since not even so famous a name could rescue them.
Stin in any case literary history must deplore ¹the loss of the
hymnbook, if only because according to the title communicated
by Beda himself, metrica] and rhythmical hymns of one and the
same author—which is very remarkable—were united. A hymn

²⁹ That siue in the title stands for
et, a common usage at that time, is
shewn not only by the distinction
of metrum and rhythmus in Beda’s
metrical treatise described below,
