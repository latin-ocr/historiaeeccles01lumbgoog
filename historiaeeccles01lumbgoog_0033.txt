⁴in commemoration of St Ceolfrid: vm& BEATORVM ABBATVM
WIREMVTHIENSIVM ET GIRVENSIVM BENEDICTI, CEOLFRIDI,
EASTERWINI, SIGFRIDI ATQVE HVETBERTI. These are the
abbats of his own fraternity, some of them his tutors and

fills the largest part of the book. Benedict, originally called
Biscop, an Angle of· noble descent‚ ‘minister' of king Oswy,

10 command attended abp Theodore from Rome to England and
afterwards founded the two monasteries on the Wear and Tyne.

and brings from Gaul ev'en the masons for churchbuilding—is

tery there. In this case, as Beda sayS, regard was had chiefly to
the concordia of the O and N T. But Benedict also brought
costly silk robes ‘of incomparable work ', which he exchanged
for land with the king and his counsellorS. For the church

then been destitute of artists in this trade. He also brought
