414 CAMBRJDGE MSS OF BEDA. [Excuksus

tains beside Beda's eccl hist a Latin MS in two different hands of the
lives of St Basil, St Euphrosyne, the passion of St Agnes, passion of
St Vincentius, passion of St Thomas of Canterbury‚ passion of St Lau-
rentius, the end of which is wanting. Then follows the Saxon version
of Gregory's Pastoral ascribed to king Alfred. Of this the first folio 5
is missmg.

In the ecclesiastical history, the prologue (there called prefatio)=
ends with mandare studuimus, the last sentence of the earliest form
of the prologue, praeterea omnes ...... inueniam, being placed at the end
of the catalogue of the works of Beda which closes book v. The sen-10
tence preceding it endS, as does the oldest form of book v, with semper

ante factem tuam.
In book 1v chapters xm xlv xv are thrown into one, x1x and xx

are kept distinct. Chap 28 of the present text is made into two chapters
by a division after dei refi’ctz'onem praebebat and the last clause duobus 1 5
autem annisis transferred to the following chapter.

After the eccl hist follows the letter of Cuthbert de tranu‘tu‘fflere
called de obitu). It includes the Saxon passage, but does not give the
Latin version thereos ε quod ita latine sonat...z'udicanda suerit.

With verbal variations the letter continues down to ineruditio Iin— 20
gieae facit, omitting the last sentence of the earlier form. This MS is of
the xtvth century.

C³ is a quarto belonging to Trinity college (R 7 5) of the lateele·
venth or early twelfth century. The hand is very similar to the speci·
mens no 60 and 62 of the Palaeographical society's issues. On the first ²5
folio is the name Matthaeus Parker.

The prologue ends at mandare studuimus and at the close of book v
after ante faciem tuam comes the sentence which in the earliest copies is ’
in the prologue praeterea omnes.. ..intercesstonis inueniam. Immedi-
ately follows a short account of the island of Lindisfarne‚ and then some 30
rude lines called prognostzka concerning the archbishops and bishops of
England, some of which seem to be anything but complimentary as

that on
Willelmus Norwicensis episcopus: Non hunc sed Barraban.
