Cadwallo by Fordun chron gent Scot. This Ceadualla, king of the 5
Brettones is not to be confounded with Ceadualla king of the Geuissi
mentioned 1v [15] and [16]. This king of the Brettones is named Cad-
walan in Layamon Madden 111 254 where a long account of all the
events comprised in this chapter is given. The orthography of this
name in the ms, though not that usually adopted, is the only form in 10

a Christian in name and profession, was in temper and habits so
barbarou3‚ as to spare neither women nor ch'ildren, torturing all,
ravaging the country, and designing the extirpation of the Angles from
Britain. He had no esteem for the Christian religion, which had grown
up among them: indeed (says Beda) to this day the Britons hold the 30
saith of the Angles in no account, and communicate with them no more
than with heathen.

„ 14 DENISESBVRNA identified generally with Dalston near
Hexham, but as Hefenfelth was north of the Roman wall (p 21 16) it
seems likely that the Rivus Denise was also to the north. For a discus- 3 5

autem locus pugnae iuxta murum illum qui uocatur Thyrlwall ad aqui-

lonem quo Romani quondam ob arcendos Scotorum impetus totam a mari
ad mare praecinxerunt Britanniam.
