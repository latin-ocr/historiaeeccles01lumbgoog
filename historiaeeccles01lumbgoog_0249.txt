T this time the West Saxons, anciently called Geuissae, were con-
verted by the preaching of bishop Birinus, He was sent by

pope Honorius and intended to penetrate into the interior of Britain,
5 but coming first to the Geuissae, and finding them pagans he tarried
and laboured there. Oswald was present when Cynigilsus king of
the Geuissae was baptized and was his sponsor. The two kingszgave
to Birinus the city of Dorcic for an episcopal seat. Birinus died there,.

but his body was afterwards removed to Venta. Cynigilsus was suc-

10 ceeded by his son Coinualch who refused to become a Christian. He
was soon afterwards driven fr0m his kingdom by Penda king of
Mercia whose sister he had put away from being his wife and married
another. Coinualch took refuge with Anna king of the East Angles
and there he became a Christian. He .was afterwards restored to his

1 5 kingdom and he made Agilberctus a bishop among his people‚ but
becoming wearied of a man whose language he did not understand
(for Agilberctus was a Gaul who had been instructed in Ireland)‚
he appointed another bishop, Vini, and Agilberctus, offended at the
division of his diocese, retired to Gaul, ¹and became bishop of Paris.

20 After a while Vini was also driven away, and procured by purchase
the bishopric of London stom the king of the MercianS. So the
Geuissae were long time without a bishop, and in that >period Coinualch
experienced great losses at the hands of his enemies3 so he desired

’ to recall Agilberctus, but that bishop excused himself and sent instead
25 his nephew Leutherius, who was consecrated bishop of the West Saxons
by Theodore archbishop of Canterbury.
