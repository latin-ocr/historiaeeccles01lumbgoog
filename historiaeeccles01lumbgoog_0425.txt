TESTIMONIA.

P 176 Τ D Hardy catalogue of materials relating to the history
20 of Great Britain . . . 1 (ι) 455 456 names several Mss and editions of
this letter, which differs greatly in different copies. By the kindness of
the Rev S S Lewis and of Dr Idtensohn the librarian of St Gall, we are
enabled to give it from the most ancient MS known.
As the epistle of Cuthbert is found in only a few MSS, it seems
2 5 worth while to give a careful collation of the four copies which
have been used for the present edition. The text is printed from MS.
