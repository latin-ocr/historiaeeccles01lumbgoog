[XXIX]

HERE was a presbyter named Hereberct who was a friend of

bishop Cudberct. This man led a solitary life on an island, in a

lake from· which the river Derwent flows. Hearing that Cudberct was

5 come to the city of ,Lugubalia he came to meet him and in that visit
Cudberct spake of his approaching death. Hereberct entreated the
holy man to pray that they might pass away together, and aster earnest
prayer he was assured by Cudberct that his request would be granted, and

so it came to pass. But Hereberct was first chastened bya long sickness,

10 that through suffering here, he might be received into the same abode
of bliss as the holy bishop. Cudberct died in the island of Fame but

was carried to Lindisfarne and buried in the church. wilfrid held that ·

bishopric for one year till Eadberct was ordained as successor to
“ , Cudberct. This man was learned in the scriptures and most note-
1 5 worthy for his many almsdeeds.
