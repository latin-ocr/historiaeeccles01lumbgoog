As late as 1740 sick children were taken to ‘Bede’s well' about

a mile to the west of Jarrow: ‘ a crooked pin was put in, and the well

5 dry between each dipping. My informant has seen twenty children

brought together on a Sunday to be dipt in this well; at which

also on Midsummer-eve there was a great resort of neighbouring

people with bonfires, music etc.’ (Brand-Ellis popular ant 1813

11 270. Surtees Durham 11 69, 80). Crooked pins are still to be seen

10 in the well. The distance between Wearmouth and Jarrow is about six

miles. Cf Dugdale new ed 1 501—4. esp Alcuin ed Jaffe pp 120.
