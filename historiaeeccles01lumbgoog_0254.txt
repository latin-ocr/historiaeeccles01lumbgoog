„ 27 FLAGRANTIA this dissimilation (cf. mulberry‚ marble, purple,
pilgrim) is consistently retained in ms. On the ‘odour of sanctity' cf p-
1101 17 n. quanta saepe flagrantia mirandi apparuerit odoratu Greg
dial lv 37 four days after the burial of TheophaneS, his wife determined 5
to change the marble laid on his tomb: quod uz'tlelzket marmor corpori
eiussuperpositum dumficisset ablatum, tanta ex corpore ipsius fra·
grantia odoris emanauit‚ ac si ex putrescente carne illius pro
u'ermibus aromata ferbuissent. Gregory examined the workmen
in the presence of clergy, nobles and people: qui et eadem odoris 10
fragrantia miro modo se repletos fuisse testati sunt. ib. 4.
Merulus a monk‚ devoted to tears and prayers and psalmody‚ saw in a
vision a crown of white flowers deseending from heaven on his head.
Fourteen years after his death tanta...de...sepulchro illius fragrantia
suauitatis emanauit, ac si illic florum omnium fuissent odora· 15
menta congregata. Sometimes the fragrant odour is related to have ’
been perceived at the time of death. Thus at the death of a certain
Servulus it is related (Aelfric Hom 11 98) “Then was the house filled
with a wondrous odour so that all the corpsebearers were filled with the
winsome fragrance and the odours ceased not in their nostrils till the 20
holy body was buried ''. Similarly at the death of the nun Romula
(ibid 548). A like fragrance is said to have pervaded the whole island
of Crowland after the death of St Guthlac Goodwin pp 86—90.
