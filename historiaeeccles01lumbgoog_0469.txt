BISHOPRICS BRITISH ΛΝΒ SAXON
· BEFORE 640AD

F the episcopate in Britain before the arrival of St Augustine we

5 have very little information. We know that British bishops were·¹
at the councils of Arles (315 ᾼΒ) and of Ariminum (359 AD) but we·
have no name of either bishop or see till the time of N inias who at the
opening of the fisth century (401 AD) was bp of Casa Candida, ie
Whitheme in Galloway (see p απ). But the British bishopS, like the

664 AD British bishops joined with Vini the Saxon bishop of Wessex in

of the establishment in that principality of a diocesan episcopate, but

15 no such information is to be obtained concerning the British bishops
who were in other pans of the country. British sees were however
gradually occupied by the Saxons and in 87'1 AD we even find a Saxon
bishop at St David's [archaeol Camb 3rd series x p 15 quoted in
Haddan·Stnbbs].

20 An therefore which it is possible to set forth with certainty is the
condition of the Saxon episcopate from the arrival of Augustine down
to 633 AD when the history of Beda bk 111 commences, Augustine
was consecrated at Arles 597 AD and came over into Kent in the
same year and held the archiepiscopal see till his death 604 Α D.

2 5 During his life the monastery of St Peter and St Paul, afterwards
called St Augustine'S‚ was commenced but not completed‚ and in the
year of ‘his death he consecrated Mellitus and Iustus, who had been sent
over to him from pope Gregory, the former to be bishop among the
East saxona with his seat at London‚ the latter to be bishop of
