402 DA Τις oF BEDA’S DEA ΤΗ. [TESTI-

day or to the eve of Ascension day? There has been uncertainty as

to the year of Beda’s death from the earliest times. All copies of the
Saxon chronicle agree on 734 A D which date is repeated by Matthew
Paris (Rolls’ series vol 1 p 335) and by Richard of Cirencester (vol 1 p 2 37).
Roget of Hoveden (vol 1 p 5) gives the traditional date 735 A D, while 5
the annals of Waverley (ann monast 11 155) place Beda’s death in
730 A D, and the annals of Worcester (ann monast lv 367) in 720 A D.
Fordun (chron gent Scot lib iii c 46) marks the date according to the
year of King Ethfyn, who began to reign, as Fordun stateS, in 730 A D.
His words are: Eius anno secundo uel, ut uolunt quidam, anno quinto, 10
Beda uenerabilis obiit. But in Mr Skene’s notes to Fordun we find
that the year of the commencement of Ethfyn’s reign is uncertain, and

it appears from Tighernac that Murdac the predecessor of Ethfyn did
not begin to reign till 733 A D and reigned 3 years ς thus Ethfyn would
come to the throne in 736 or 737 and his second year would be 738 or 15
739 A D, while his fifth would be 741 or 74² A D. Baronius taking
v11 id mai sor the correct reading places the death in 776 A D,
though it is difficult to see why. There is therefore a great un·
certainty in all our records concerning the year of Beda's death,
and against this we have the testimony of a MS of the 9th century 20
that the day of his death was 9th May, and that this day was Ascension
eve. Nothing is more likely than that aster the canonisation persons
remembering the story that he died on Ascension day, which would

be the form that tradition would assume, would seek sor a date near
the time when he must have died which would square with their 2 5
tradition. But sorgetful (or ignorant) of the sact that what was called
Ascension day was really Ascension eve, they fixed on 735 A D, a year

in which May 26th was Ascension day. So that we may lay that date
(735 A D) aside altogether, because Ascension eve in that year was
May 25th. Now Ascension eve between the years 730 and 800 was on 30
May 26th only in 751, 762 and 773, all of thern years too late in the
century sor usto assign the death of Beda to any of them. We may
therefore give up vu kal iunii altogether. When we come to consider
the other date, May 9th, we find that Ascension day feu on that day
only in 720 and 799, both impossible dates, but Ascension eve was 35
on May 9th in 731, 742, 750. The first year is too early, for Beda’s
history continues till that date, and the third too late for the year in
which Beda died 3 we therefore are shut up to A D 742, and on· the 9th

of May in that year we conclude that Beda's death occurred.
