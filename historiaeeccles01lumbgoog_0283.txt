5 P 67 1 FAMILIARVM Lingard 1 370 ‘the lands os the Anglo·Saxon
tribes were parcelled out by measurement or estimation into shares or

allotmentS, each of which was supposed to be capable of yielding a
competent support to the settler, his family, labourerS‚ herds and flocks.

By Beda these shares are uniformly called tenue fa'miliarum’. In king
10 Alfred‘s version terra familiae is here (and usually) rendered ‘hide'‚
but below (p 68 l 8) by fhlcs. ‘ Beda'S...terra familiae is the Latin
translation of folcland3...the shares (folcscearu) into which the lands of
the tribe were originally divided, were mlled folclandS, and were
governed by folet-ibt, or the custom of the country, until they were taken
1 5 out of the common stock and converted by competent authority into
boclands, or estates in perpetuity‚ or for a term of lives, with remain-
der to some other party sor ever.’
