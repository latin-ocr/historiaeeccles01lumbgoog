Osuald’s tomb. He remained there till the hour of the attack was past,
and was freed from his malady. The brother who related this to Beda

he died with a prayer for his soldiers on his lips and the words of his

prayer passed into a proverb. The head hands and arms of King ’

Osuald had been cut from his body and put on stakes, but afterwards
Oswy recovered them and put the head in the church at Lindisfarne
2 5 and the hands ancl arms in that at the royal city of Bebbanburgh.
