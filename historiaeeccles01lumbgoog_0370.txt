344 QUEEN AEDJL THR YDA. [IV

[XIX]

IN G Ecgfrid took to wife Aedilthryda daughter of Anna king of
the East Angles. She had formerly been the wife of Tondberct
duke of the South Gyruii. She lived with Ecgfrid twelve yearS, but in
both marriages she remained glorious in the integrity of her virginity. 5
Hence it was that after her death her body remained uncorrupted. She
long entreated to be allowed to retire into a. monastery, and at last
entered that which was presided over by the abbess Aebba at Coludi
Urbs (Coldingham). But within about a year she was herself made
abbess at Elge (Ely) where she built a monastery. She never wore 1 0
linen aster her entry on the monastic life, and seldom used warm baths.
She spent much time in prayer, and· was able to foretell a pestilence of
which she herself was to die, and also to declare how many of the
inhabitants of that monastery should die of the same plague. She was
buried in a wooden coffin at first, but her sister Sexburga, who succeeded 1 5
her as abbesS, caused her body to be taken up, aster it had been buried
for sixteen yearS, and then it was found to be free from corruption, and
those who were sent forth to seek a stone for a new coffin, found a coffin of
marble and a lid of the same marvellously put in readiness for them near
the walls of the city of Grantchester. The physician Cynefrid tells how 20
on examination of the body, the wound, which he had made by laneing
a tumour on the neck of the abbess shortly before she died, was found
to be healed up. Her garments also were fresh as new. ΤΙιε pain of
her tumour Aedilthryda counted as a punishment for the needless weight
. of necklaces she had worn when young and as a sign that God by this 2 5
chastisement absolved her from the guilt of idle levity. By the touch of
her garments demons were put to ssight and diseases cured. Blind
people recovered sight by praying at the wooden coffin. The marble
coffin was exactly fitted to the body of the virgin. Elge ιε in the pro·

vince of East Anglia, and is so called from the number of eels that are 30
caught ιιι the marshes there.
