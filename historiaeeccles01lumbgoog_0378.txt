[XX]

EDA here inserts a hymn in praise of virginity and especially 20
of Aedilthryda, which he composed in elegiae metre many years
before. He thus imitates Holy Scriptum, the historica] parts of which
are varied by the insertion of compositions in metre and verse.

P 130 28 this chapter is omitted in the Saxon version.
