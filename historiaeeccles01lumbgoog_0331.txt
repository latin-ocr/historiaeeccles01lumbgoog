5 SOON after this Vynfrid bishop of the Mercians was for some offence
deposed by archbishop Theodore, and Sexwulf the founder and
abbat of Medehamstede was consecrated in his place. Vynfrid retired
to the monastery of Adbaruae where he died. Theodore made Earconuald
bishop of the East Saxons. This was. a most holy man, so that
1 0 even the litter in which he was drawn about in his feeble age cures
many that are sick when they are put under or near it. Splinters from
it have also a great and healing virtue. This Earconuald, before hisi
consecration, built two monasteries, one for himself at Chertsey‚ and the
other for his sister Aedilburga at Barking. She was of the same piety as
15 her brother, and took great care of those who were under her in her .
monastery, and heavenly miracles gave evidence to her holiness.
