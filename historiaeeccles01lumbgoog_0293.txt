26] BISHOP COLMAN RE TURNS To SCOTLAND. 277

XXVI

HEN Colman saw his opinions rejected he returned to Scotland
’ to consult with his friends there what he ought to do. Bishop
’ Cedd adopted the catholic use in his own see. This synod was in
5 664 A D. Tuda succeeded Colman as bishop in Northumbria, and
Eata abbat of Mailros was made abbat of Lindisfarne. 'I’ his Eata
was one of twelve boys whom Aedan had taken from among the
Angles for special instruction· and he afterwards became bishop of
Lindisfarne. Colman took with him into Scotland some of 'the bones
10 of bishop Aedan. ΤΙιε humble style of all the buildings of the com·
munity over which he presided shews the frugality and sels-denial of
Colman and his predecessorS. They kept no money, built no houses
for the reception of the visits of great men, their thought being to
serve God and not the world. Thus men of religion were held in
1 5 great veneration‚ and their preaching and other ministrations much
sought anto, This continued to be the character of the Northumbrian
church for a long time afterwards,

his disciples to refuse communion to those who dissented from the
Roman usage3 yet he was prior of Aedan’s foundation Lindisfarne.

on the practice of S* Peter, prince of the apostleS‚ and porter of heaven.
King Oswy hearing this was affrighted, who had rather anger all the
other eleven apostles than offend St Peter, one so high in power and.
