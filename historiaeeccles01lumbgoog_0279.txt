23] ‡ BISHOP CEDD. 263

Cedd chose a situation amid lofty and remote mountain& a place fit
for the haunt of robbers and wil'd beastS. By long prayers and fasting
he purified the place, intending to fast during the whole of Lent except
on Sundays till the evening and then to take but very little food.
5 After ten days Cedd was summoned by the king, and his brother and
presbyter Cynibill continued the fast. The monastery was at a place
called Laestingaeu. Cedd aster many years of episcopal labour died
. there in a time of great mortality. He was first buried outside, but
when a new church was built, his remains were laid on the right side

10 of the altar. He had made his brother Ceadda who afterwards was
also a bishop head of the monastery. All four brothers were eminent
priests and two of them bishops When the East Saxons heard of
Cedd’s death, about thirty monks came thence to Laestingaeu to live
near the body of their father, but all save one died in the same

15 pestilence. The survivor, a little boy, was saved through the prayers
of the father. This child had not been baptised‚ and the supplications
of Cedd saved him from perdition, and he afterwards being baptised
became a presbyter and a minister of life to others,

cemetery of the brethren.' He cites the example of Byrhtnoth‚ ealdor-

at Ely.

to dwell in the wilderness that he would never taste aught but barley
bread and water, and that he did not take till the sun was set p 27.
