a principal part. Not only are the most natural things wrested
into miracleS, but all the saint's tranceS, who like St Martin
believed that he was often visited by angels and devils, pass
§current as simple truth ; to say nothing of his sympathetic
cures· On the other hand however the book is not wholly
devoid of real historica] factS, which give it greater worth. Thus
we read (c 9 sqq) how Cuthbert as provost os Melrose at the
time of the plague withstood the' general relapse into heathen
10 superstition by journeying alone for months through the country
preaching, or hoW, when transferred to Lindisfarne, 116 intro-
duced a stricter rule into this monastery afterwards so famous,
or lastly how as a hermit in the rocky islet Fame 116 led a
solitary Robinson-Crusoe kind of life (here depicted in all detail),

deliberations (6 24), or to the ,bishop's throne (AD 685), which
however he filled only two yearS, then to return to his hermitage.
As Beda grounds this prose life of a saint on a poem of his

own, so t00, probably at an earlier date, he wrote on the basis
20 of Paulinus’ natalicia a shorter prose life of St Felix, because,
as he says in th'e preface, the hexameters of Paulinus were more
accessible to ‘ metrica] ' than to plain readers. For the benefit of
these latter, the great majority, he had executed the work on the
model of the prose metaphrast of Prudentius' hymn on CassianuS.
