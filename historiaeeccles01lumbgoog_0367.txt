[xvm]

Ar the synod of Hatfield was present John the chief precentor
onst Peter's at Rome, whom pope Agatho had lately sent to
Britain in the company of Benedict Biscop. This Benedict was the

5 founder of a monastery in Britain near the mouth of the river Wear.
The precentor John was sent to Britain that he might teach the course

of church singing according to the use of St Peter's at Rome. He
instructed the dwellers m the above -named monastery and many others

’ who thronged to learn, in reading as well as chanting. He also en-
10 quired into the belief held m the church of the Angles and reported there·
on to pope Agatho, who desired to preserve the church free from pre·
vailing heresies. This John, returning to Rome, fell ill and died on the
way and was buried at Tours, at which place he had been enter·
tained when he was coming to Britain. A report of the catholic saith of

⁷ 1 5 the Angles was however conveyed to the pope.
