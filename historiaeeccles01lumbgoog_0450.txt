other evidence as to the date of the MS, this last 'mentioned change and
the constant occurrence of th instead of p or -δ would lead to the sup·
position that the date of the 9th century assigned to it is too early. As

it isthere is not known so early a manuscript elsewhere in which these
changes are so found. For an account of the particular words in the 5
passage see Saxon Glossary.

P 177 20 o mex omnum the antiphon for the magnifioet on the
feast of *the Ascension (breuiarium Rom in ascensione domini ‘ in 11 ·
uesperis '); the only words omitted are sed mitte promissum patris in nos
spiritum um‘tatzlr. Beda has a homily (11 9 in Migne xclv 174—181) 10
on the Ascension‚ which concludes thus: ‘ Behold in our Redeemer's
ascension we have learnt to what end all our endeavours must be bent:
behold, as the Mediator of God and men ascends into the heavens, we
have learnt that the gate os the heavenly fatherland is thrown open to men.

Let us therefore hasten with all zeal to the everl‘asting happiness of this 1 5
fatherland. In this, as in body we cannot yet dwell, let us ever dwell in
desire and mind. According to the saying of the noble preacher, let ns seek
things above, where Christ is seated at God's right hand, let us mind

the things above, not the things which are on earth. Let us seek Him
and be established by the hope of finding: let us seek His sace ever- 20
more, and when He who was meek in His ascent, shall be terrible in
His return, may He find us ready to be introduced with Him to} the
festivals of the heavenly city)
