bishop he asked the meaning of those heavenly voices which he had heard,
and learnt that they were the angelic spirits who had been sent to tell
Ceadda that he should be called to his heavenly reward in seven days.

And so it came to pass. Beda then narrates how the life of Ceadda ·

5 was conspicuous for many merits but especially for his great sense of the
close presence of God, which made him earnest in his prayers in all
times of storm and tempest.

. A discourse of the reverend father Ecgberct supports the evidence of
⁴ Ouini. Ecgberct had been a companion of Ceadda in Ireland but he

10 never returned to England. He was however visited by a holy man

named Hygbald, and to him he said, “I know a person who at the time
of Ceadda's death saw the soul of Cedcl his brother come from heaven
with angels to escort the dying bishop to the heavenly kingdom.”
Whether he spake of himself is not known. Ceadda's body was first
1 5 buried close to St Mary's church‚ but was afterwards translated into the
church of St Peter. In both places miracles were wrought for a token
of his virtue. A frenzied man by accident sleeping on the place was
found to be cured in the morning. Also the dust of the ground there
when mixed with water has effected wondrous cures. As a successor to
20.Ceadda, Theodore ordained Vynsrid who had been a deacon under
Ceadda for a considerable time.
