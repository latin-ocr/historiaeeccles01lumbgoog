tiens), the moon's orbit (c 17) and its importance for the calen-
dar, to which are added many explanations about the moon
and also about its relation to the tides (c 29), again the equi-
noxes and solstice5‚ the unequal lengths of the dayS, the seasons
5of the year, natural yearS, the intercalary day, the nineteen⁴
years’ cycle and its division, the reckoning after Christ’s birth
(c 47), indictionS, epacts‚ the cycle of the moon, the determi-
nation of Easter3 all which matters are taught at- once with
great theoretical thoroughneSS, and with all regard to the prac-
ιο tical application of these instructions· Beda a150‚ as he says
c 65, appended to the work a table for Easter from ΑΙ) 532,
‘when Dionysius began the first cycle'‚ to A D 1063.

15 very title indicateS, Beda has divided his chronicle according
to the ages of the world, following indeed Isidore's example-—
from whom he has also borrowed some passages word for
word—but principally keeping in view Augustine himself,
the proper author, as we have seen, of thatv division; the
20 justification for which accordingly Beda in his introduction
takes even verbatim, from the ciuitas dei. Hence as compared
with Isidore, if we neglect borrowed detaiIS, Beda appears
altogether original. Much rather is Augustine his guide,
Eusebius-Jerome his principal source, both of whom also he
23 often citeS. Following Augustine's authority Beda 'reckons
⁴ the years of the world according to the Hebrew original of the
Ο Τ, not according 'to the LXX, as Isidore. Not seldom too
Beda gives much more than the latter, even entire sections:
thus in the beginning of the fifth age the series of N ebu-

Cyrus to Darius, whereas Isidore only begins with Darius3
