Al) VERTISEMENT. ’ vii

For ‘ cursory reading' few Latin-writers are better
adapted than Beda, whose perspicuity stands out in
strong relies from the bombast affected by Aldhelm
before him, and by most of our chroniclers for cen-
turies after him. ⁶

It will be well for England if her church cleaves
stedsastly to the rule of ‘learning and working’ (see
pp 226 227) professed and practised by Beda and his*
worthieS, and in these latter days revived among us
in the teaching and life of F D Maurice.

The examples given in the glossary are intended
to be supplementary to those stored in the lexiconS.

We have to than‘k the authorities of Trinity,
Sidney Sussex, Emmanuel and St John’s collegeS,
for the free use of manuscripts,
