LiTERATURE oF EARLY BRITISH AND
1RISH CHURCH HISTORY

T is still' true, as in ·Warburton’s time, that our only church histo-
rians are ‘ the jester F uller and Collier the nonjuror.' The ‘ annals' of 5
Alford, following the method of Batonius, are now of little intrinsic
value3 Ussher's antiquitates on the other hand may still be consulted
with profit. Soames is a polemio, far less instructive than his Romish
rivals ε The history and antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon church by John
Lingard‚ London 1858 2 vols 3 The church of our fatherS, as seen in 10
St Osmund's rite for the cathedral os Salisbury, with dissertations on the
belief and ritual in England before and after the coming of the NormanS,
by Daniel Rock, London 1849—1853 3 vols in 5 parts. See now es-
pecially W Bright ‘chapters of early English church history Oxford
1878.‘ A few pages in Kemble’s Saxons in England contain the most ¹5
trustworthy account extant; something too may be gleaned from Free-
man’s Norman conquest. Much vafuable material still lurks in manu·
script in the libraries of London, Rome, Oxford, Cambridge, Lambcth,
York, Damam, and many otherS, public and private (some of which
the ‘ historical mss commission' is for the first time bringing to light). 20
A few important mss (including the collections of Wharton, Hutton,
Kennett) and printed books are registered in the preface to ‘registrum
sacrum Anglicanum by W Stubbs‚ Oxford 1858!
